Avenida De Las Camelias has a rich and fascinating history that reflects the cultural and political context of Argentina. The march was composed by Pedro Maranesi, an Italian immigrant who arrived in Argentina in 1896. He joined the Argentine Army as a musician and became the leader of the symphonic band of the 6th Division. He composed several marches and songs for the army, but Avenida De Las Camelias was his most famous and successful work. [^1^]
  
The march was inspired by a street in Rosario de la Frontera, a town in the province of Salta, where Maranesi lived and worked as a music teacher. The street was named after the camellias that grew there, and Maranesi decided to pay tribute to it by naming his march after it. He composed the march on the patch of a bass drum, using a simple but catchy melody and harmonies. He also added some elements of Argentine folk music, such as the chacarera rhythm and the use of pentatonic scales. [^1^] [^3^]
  
The march quickly became popular among the Argentine soldiers and civilians, who appreciated its lively and upbeat tempo and its patriotic spirit. It was adopted as one of the official marches of the Argentine Army, along with the March of San Lorenzo, another famous military march composed by Cayetano Alberto Silva. Avenida De Las Camelias was played in numerous parades and ceremonies, both in Argentina and abroad. It was also used as a soundtrack for several movies and documentaries about the Argentine history and culture. [^1^] [^2^]
  
However, the march also had some controversial moments in its history. The original score of Avenida De Las Camelias was lost during the Falklands War in 1982, when it was taken as a war trophy by British soldiers who raided an Argentine military camp. The score was never recovered, and only copies and transcriptions remain. The march was also used profusely by the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983, as a way of promoting nationalism and militarism. Some people associated the march with repression and violence, and rejected it as a symbol of democracy and freedom. [^1^] [^3^]
  
Despite these controversies, Avenida De Las Camelias remains one of the most beloved and respected marches in Argentina. It is still performed by the Argentine Armed Forces and other musical bands, as well as by amateur musicians and singers who enjoy its beauty and significance. It is also recognized as a cultural heritage that represents the spirit and identity of Argentina, a country that has been shaped by immigration, diversity, and resilience. [^1^] [^3^]
