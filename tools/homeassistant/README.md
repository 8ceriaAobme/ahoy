Disclaimer: these are collected examples from https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/525778 (Page 12)

in manual.yaml you will find the setup for manual configuration, adapt your name (Terrasse) and the topic (inverter) to your needs and place it into configuration.yaml

in autodiscovery.yaml you will find the setup for automatic discovery of the inverter

Note: the config might need adaption to your system (mqtt, homeassistant etc)
